## Description
In this website I share about myself and the projects I have completed. For the developement of this site I took inspiration from Pinterest and Apple. I developed this site using React, Tailwind, and CSS. For CI/CD, I have my local repo which I update and push to my github repo. I have added a deploy.yaml file that creates a github action pipeline to update and build the project. After this is complete the "build" branch is updated with the latest minified files. In my Hostinger hPanel, I have configured settings so any changes to the build branch are automatically reflected to my live website. 

## Tools used
* React
* Tailwind
* CSS
* Hostinger
* Github
